            <h4>SHYMKENT, 2021</h4>
      <p class="p-aboutme-shymkent">
        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹. 
        Once upon a time, I was a rebellious teenager named Batyrbek who lived in the bustling city of Shymkent. I was a student at Nurorda, one of the most prestigious schools in the region. I had a fiery spirit and was always seeking out adventures that would take me to the edge of excitement and danger. My love for sports was undeniable, and I was a passionate boxer, a swift tennis player, and a calculating chess master. I was a force to be reckoned with both in and out of the school grounds. My friends and I would often be found engaging in friendly matches at the local boxing ring, tennis court, or chess club.
        One sunny day, my friends and I stumbled upon an abandoned building rumored to be haunted. Naturally, I took the lead, and we entered the building. As we explored its dark corners and mysterious rooms, we uncovered a secret passage that led to a hidden underground room. To our surprise, we found a stash of old tennis rackets, boxing gloves, and a dusty chessboard. I challenged my friends to a series of friendly games in our favorite sports, and we spent the entire day in that hidden room, competing and forging memories we would never forget.

      <h5>A few thoughts on my birthplace</h5>
      <p class="p-aboutme-shymkent">
        Growing up in Shymkent, Kazakhstan's third-largest city, I cherished its vibrant energy and rich culture. I appreciated the historical sites nearby, like the ancient city of Sayram, and enjoyed exploring lively bazaars, filled with colorful fruits, spices, and handcrafted textiles.
        Shymkent's beautiful parks offered relaxation and tranquility, while the city's traditional Kazakh cuisine, including beshbarmak and manti, created cherished memories with friends and family. The blend of history, tradition, and modernity made me proud to call Shymkent my diverse and culturally rich hometown.

        ASTANA, 2020
      </h4>
      <p class="p-aboutme-astana">
        However, life had a different plan for me. In the 10th grade, I had to relocate to Astana with my family. With a heavy heart, I bid farewell to my hometown, Shymkent, and my beloved school, Nurorda. The move to Astana was daunting, and I struggled to adjust to my new environment. The rebellious spirit that once defined me in Shymkent was replaced by a timid demeanor in the face of the unknown.
  
        In Astana, I joined a new school and was determined to continue pursuing my passions in boxing, tennis, and chess. I decided to find local clubs and communities where I could engage in my favorite sports. This was my chance to rekindle the adventurous spirit that once defined me.
  
         With renewed determination, I trained harder than ever before. I spent hours at the boxing gym, perfected my backhand on the tennis court, and sharpened my strategic thinking over the chessboard. As I immersed myself in these activities, I could feel my old self coming back, the rebellious spirit that thrived on adventure and excitement.
  
        Soon enough, I gained a reputation for being a formidable opponent in all three sports. I felt a surge of pride as I embraced my newfound confidence, knowing that I had conquered not only my fears and insecurities but also found a way to stay true to myself in my new city.
  
        From that day on, I vowed to never let my spirit be dampened again, no matter where life took me. I would continue to pursue my love for adventure, chasing after new experiences that would push me to the limits of my abilities. The memories of my hometown, Shymkent, and my school, Nurorda, would always be a part of me, but now I also had new stories to tell, and new triumphs to celebrate.

        <h5>Architectural wonderland</h5>
        <p class="p-aboutme-astana">
          Five years ago, I relocated to Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan's capital, during my 10th-grade year in high school. The city's striking architecture and futuristic atmosphere inspired my curiosity and creativity. Adjusting to a new high school brought diverse friendships, academic excellence, and extracurricular activities, enriching my overall educational experience.
Nur-Sultan's blend of tradition and modernity exposed me to a vibrant cultural scene, with performances at the Astana Opera and national celebrations like Nauryz. Adapting to the colder climate was challenging, but I learned to embrace the beauty of snow and winter activities.
In retrospect, moving to Nur-Sultan provided growth, opportunities, and a strong foundation for my future endeavors.
